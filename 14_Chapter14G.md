# Chapter 14: Gradient Descent Algorithms

Welcome back dear reader to our journey on Advanced Online Algorithms in Python! In the previous chapter (Chapter 13: Geometric Online Convex Optimization), we discussed online convex optimization algorithms that make updates to the model that maintain convexity at all times. In this chapter, we will step into the world of Gradient Descent algorithms.

Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize a function by moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. When used in the context of Machine Learning, we use Gradient Descent algorithms to optimize the parameters of a cost function that models the relationship between input data and the predicted output.

In this chapter, we will focus on developing an intuition about Gradient descent and how we can use it to train our Machine Learning models in an online setting. We will talk about different variations of Gradient Descent algorithms such as Batch, Stochastic, and Mini-batch gradient descent. We will look at examples of these algorithms in Python code and show how we can implement them for Online Learning.

Are you excited to learn about the power of Gradient Descent algorithms? I hope you are, because the mystery we have in store for you today will test your understanding of how it works in practice. So, sit tight and let the mystery unfold.

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes had just finished a long day of work when he received a call from his friend and fellow detective, Dr. John Watson. Watson told him that a wealthy businessman had seemingly disappeared into thin air, and asked for his help in finding him.

Holmes agreed to take on the case, and began investigating. He soon discovered that the businessman, Mr. Smith, had a particular interest in Machine Learning and had been working on a new algorithm using Gradient Descent. In fact, Smith believed that he had made a breakthrough in developing an algorithm that could learn from data online in real-time.

Holmes thought that it was interesting and decided to investigate further. He found out that Smith had left behind a notebook with some code and notes on the algorithm. After examining the notebook, Holmes suspected that Smith had discovered how to use an online version of Gradient Descent to solve complex optimization problems that could change dynamically with changing data. 

Holmes decided to investigate further and implemented Smith's algorithm using Python.

## The Solution

After some time, Holmes managed to decode the algorithm and understand how it worked. He saw that Smith had been using a variation of Stochastic Gradient Descent that incorporated an additional regularization term. This technique penalized the model for becoming too complex and was a useful trick to avoid overfitting in the model.

Holmes also learned that Smith had been training the algorithm on a large dataset and a complex model. As the dataset was so big, Smith divided it into mini-batches and used batch normalization to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm. 

Once the mystery of the algorithm was solved, Holmes presented his findings to Watson. He explained that Smith's algorithm would work well for high dimensional datasets and could be used for real-time predictions.

Holmes concluded that Smith, like many scientists in the field, had been working hard to develop algorithms that could work well on varying and potentially infinite amounts of data, and that Gradient Descent was proving to be one of the most effective techniques to do so.

## Explaining the Code

To solve the mystery of Mr. Smith's algorithm, Sherlock Holmes implemented the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm, which is a popular variation of the Gradient Descent algorithm that is frequently used for training Machine Learning models. 

In the code, we first start with importing the required libraries and packages, and then we define the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm with regularization as follows:

```
import numpy as np

class StochasticGradientDescent:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, regularization=0.1):
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.reg = regularization
        self.theta = None
        
    def _add_intercept(self, X):
        intercept = np.ones((X.shape[0], 1))
        return np.concatenate((intercept, X), axis=1)
    
    def fit(self, X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=32):
        X = self._add_intercept(X)
        self.theta = np.zeros(X.shape[1])
        for i in range(epochs):
            batch_index = np.random.choice(X.shape[0], batch_size)
            X_batch = X[batch_index]
            y_batch = y[batch_index]
            gradient = (2/batch_size) * X_batch.T.dot(X_batch.dot(self.theta) - y_batch) 
                      + (2*self.reg/batch_size)*self.theta
            self.theta -= self.lr * gradient
            
    def predict(self, X):
        X = self._add_intercept(X)
        return X.dot(self.theta)
```

Here, we define the class `StochasticGradientDescent` containing the necessary functions. The `__init__` function initializes the learning rate and regularization parameters. The `_add_intercept` function adds a column of ones to the feature matrix to correspond to the intercept term. The `fit` function trains the algorithm on a given training set using mini-batches with a certain batch size and regularization parameter. The `predict` function predicts the target values for a given feature matrix.

With this code, we can train our algorithm on a dataset with many features and obtain the optimal parameters. Once the algorithm is trained, we can then use it to predict the target values for new data points effectively.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we have covered the concept of Gradient Descent algorithms, which is a powerful optimization method used in Machine Learning for model training. We talked about Stochastic Gradient Descent, which is a variation of Gradient Descent that works well in online settings with large datasets.

We also solved a Sherlock Holmes mystery where we used Python to implement Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm to understand how the online version of Gradient Descent could be used to update the model and perform online learning on complex and evolving data.

Now, dear reader, you are equipped with the knowledge of how Gradient Descent can be used for Online Learning in Python. Use it wisely and keep the mystery-solving alive!
