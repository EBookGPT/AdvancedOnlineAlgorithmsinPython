# Chapter 8: The Mysterious Case of the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm

Greetings, dear reader! You have arrived at the eighth chapter of our book, where we delve into yet another mind-boggling mystery, this time involving the enigmatic Upper Confidence Bound algorithm.

But first, allow me to introduce our special guest for this chapter - the renowned Aaditya Ramdas! A prominent figure in the field of machine learning and online algorithms, Aaditya Ramdas is known for his pioneering work on UCB algorithms, among other things. As we unravel the mystery before us, we shall look to Mr. Ramdas for his expert insights and guidance.

Now, let us turn our attention to the case at hand. Our intrepid detective, Sherlock Holmes, has been called to investigate a curious situation at a local casino. Several patrons have reported an unusual experience while playing the slot machines. It seems that while some machines consistently pay out moderate amounts, others occasionally pay out large sums, even though they are played less frequently. This has led to some patrons speculating that certain machines are more "lucky" than others.

However, the casino staff insists that all machines are fair and that there is no way to predict whether a machine will pay out or not. Intrigued by the mystery, Sherlock Holmes decides to take matters into his own hands and investigates the machines himself.

Accompanied by his trusty companion, Dr. John Watson, Sherlock Holmes begins his investigation by examining the payout histories of all the slot machines in the casino. As he scrutinizes the data, he soon realizes that the machines do indeed have different payout rates. Some machines pay out more often than others, and some pay out larger amounts than others.

Thus, the question arises - how can one optimally choose which machine to play in order to maximize their winnings? The answer lies in a sophisticated online algorithm known as the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm.

In the next sections, we shall introduce the UCB algorithm and explore how it can be used to solve the curious case of the casino slot machines. Join us, as we venture deeper into the mysteries of online algorithms and discover the secrets of the UCB algorithm!
# Chapter 8: The Mysterious Case of the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm

Greetings, dear reader! You have arrived at the eighth chapter of our book, where we delve into yet another mind-boggling mystery, this time involving the enigmatic Upper Confidence Bound algorithm.

But first, allow me to introduce our special guest for this chapter - the renowned Aaditya Ramdas! A prominent figure in the field of machine learning and online algorithms, Aaditya Ramdas is known for his pioneering work on UCB algorithms, among other things. As we unravel the mystery before us, we shall look to Mr. Ramdas for his expert insights and guidance.

Our story begins on a hot summer day in London, as Sherlock Holmes is enjoying a cup of tea in his apartment. Suddenly, he receives a mysterious letter from a wealthy businessman, Mr. Robert Smith. The letter informs Sherlock of a peculiar problem that has been plaguing Mr. Smith's business - the distribution of his product to various retailers in the city.

Mr. Smith, who produces sparkling water, has been facing difficulties in selecting which retailer to supply more of his product to. Some retailers seem to sell more bottles of his sparkling water, while others sell fewer bottles, leading to a discrepancy in the profits of the retailers. Mr. Smith believes that there must be an optimal way of distributing his product to maximize his profits, but he has been unable to figure it out.

Intrigued by the case, Sherlock decides to take it on and enlists the help of Dr. John Watson. Together, they begin investigating the sales data of Mr. Smith's product at different retailers, but they quickly realize that this is a difficult problem, as the sales numbers keep changing over time.

As they pondered the problem, Aaditya Ramdas arrives at the doorstep of Sherlock Holmes and offers to help with the case. Aaditya explains to the duo about the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm, an online algorithm that can be used to solve the problem of choosing which retailer to supply more of Mr. Smith's product to, based on the sales data.

With Aaditya's guidance, Sherlock and Watson implement the UCB algorithm, which uses statistical analysis to track the performance of the retailers and update the supply distribution in real-time. The algorithm balances the exploitation of the best performing retailers with the exploration of the less known retailers, giving Mr. Smith the optimal supply distribution.

After a few weeks of testing, the UCB algorithm proves to be successful, with Mr. Smith seeing a significant increase in his profits. Sherlock and Watson successfully solve the case of the distribution of Mr. Smith's sparkling water product, and Mr. Smith is grateful for their assistance.

As the mystery comes to a close, Sherlock ponders the power of online algorithms in solving real-world problems. The UCB algorithm, in particular, has been instrumental in solving the problem of choosing an optimal distribution of Mr. Smith's sparkling water product to various retailers.

With a sense of satisfaction, Sherlock and Watson bid farewell to Aaditya Ramdas, thanking him for his valuable assistance in yet another exciting case involving online algorithms.
Sure, let me explain the code used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery using the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm.

## Implementation of the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm

The Upper Confidence Bound algorithm is an online algorithm that can be used to solve multi-armed bandit problems, which involve selecting one of several options with uncertain rewards.

The algorithm involves maintaining estimates of the expected reward of each option (in this case, each retailer's sales performance), and then choosing the option with the highest expected reward. However, to balance the tradeoff between exploiting the current best option, and exploring other unexplored options, the algorithm adds an exploration term to the expected reward estimates based on their uncertainty.

The algorithm can be implemented as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

#Initialization phase
num_retailers = 10
num_rounds = 1000
rewards = np.zeros(num_retailers)
counts = np.zeros(num_retailers)

#Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
for i in range(num_rounds):
    #Select retailer with highest UCB score
    ucb = rewards / counts + np.sqrt(2 * np.log(i + 1) / counts)
    retailer = np.argmax(ucb)
    
    #Simulate reward from retailer
    reward = simulate_reward(retailer)
    
    #Update reward and count estimates for retailer
    rewards[retailer] += reward
    counts[retailer] += 1
```

## Explanation of the Code

The code starts by initializing the number of retailers and the number of rounds to run the algorithm for. In this case, we are running the algorithm for 1000 rounds.

```python
num_retailers = 10
num_rounds = 1000
```

Next, we create two arrays - one to store the reward estimates for each retailer, and the other to store the count of times each retailer has been selected.

```python
rewards = np.zeros(num_retailers)
counts = np.zeros(num_retailers)
```

Then, we run a loop for the specified number of rounds. In each round, the algorithm selects the retailer with the highest UCB score, which balances the exploitation of the best performing retailer with the exploration of the other retailers. To compute the UCB score, we add an exploration term to the estimated reward based on its uncertainty.

```python
for i in range(num_rounds):
    #Compute UCB scores for each retailer
    ucb = rewards / counts + np.sqrt(2 * np.log(i + 1) / counts)
    
    #Select retailer with highest UCB score
    retailer = np.argmax(ucb)
```

Once the retailer is selected, we simulate the reward from the retailer and update the reward and count estimates for the retailer.

```python
    #Simulate reward from retailer
    reward = simulate_reward(retailer)
    
    #Update reward and count estimates for retailer
    rewards[retailer] += reward
    counts[retailer] += 1
```

## Conclusion

That's a brief explanation of the code used to implement the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm and solve the Sherlock Holmes mystery of the optimal distribution of Mr. Smith's sparkling water product. As you can see, the UCB algorithm is a powerful tool for solving online optimization problems and can be readily applied to a variety of contexts.
