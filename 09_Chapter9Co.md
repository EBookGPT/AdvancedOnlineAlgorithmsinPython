# Chapter 9: Contextual Bandit Algorithms

Welcome back to our journey into the world of Advanced Online Algorithms in Python. In the previous chapter, we delved into the realm of Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithms, discussing how they are used in the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, and examining their advantages and limitations.

In this chapter, we will continue exploring another powerful algorithm, which is the Contextual Bandit Algorithm. This algorithm is similar to the traditional machine learning algorithms, but with the significant difference that it operates in an online setting. This means that it learns from a stream of data instead of offline batches that are characteristic of conventional machine learning models.

The Contextual Bandit Algorithm is an extension of the multi-armed bandit algorithm. In this approach, the agent is required to pick an action, and then the environment will respond with a reward based on that action. Similarly, in this form of reinforcement learning, contextual bandit algorithms require agents to operate in environments with contextual information, where the agent must learn the relationship between the relevant contextual features and the actions to take to optimize the reward.

In the chapters ahead, we will explore how Contextual Bandit Algorithms are used in several real-world applications, including marketing, recommendation systems, and medicine. We will also showcase how to implement these models in Python programming language using various libraries to enable us to solve a real-world problem.

So, let's unravel the mystery of Contextual Bandit Algorithms and see how they can be used to revolutionize online decision-making processes.

## The Case of the Online Advertising Dilemma

Sherlock Holmes had been in his apartment for hours with his eyes glued to the computer screen, browsing through various data on his laptop. I could sense that he was so engrossed in what he saw before him that he barely noticed my questioning stare even after I had entered his apartment. 

"What sorcery is this, Holmes?" I finally asked as his fingers danced ferociously on the keyboard.

"These are online advertisements, Watson," Holmes said with a sigh. "Recently, I've been tasked with optimizing their placement for one of our clients. However, the challenge is that the effectiveness of these advertisements vary drastically depending on which user is visiting which page. There has to be a way to optimize ad placement!"

I could see the big picture now. There are no easy ways to distribute online ads correctly, especially in a world where personalized ad experiences are the norm. 

"The answer lies in Contextual Bandit Algorithms," I exclaimed, after realizing what he was staring at on his screen. 

It wasn't hard for Holmes to grasp the concept of the algorithm as it is not so different from other algorithms he had dealt with before. He quickly delved into the code and started playing around with the rewards using Python Libraries.

#### Implementation of the Contextual Bandit Algorithm

```python
class ContextualBandit:
    def __init__(self):
        self.theta = np.random.normal(0,1,[num_features, num_actions])
        
    def pull(self, x):
        values = np.dot(x, self.theta)
        action = np.argmax(values)
        return action
    
    def update(self, x, a, r):
        self.theta[:,a] += learning_rate*(r-np.dot(x,self.theta[:,a]))*x
```

Within hours, we had optimized the ads to be placed on leads based on their behavior and were able to provide the best personalized ad experience for the users. 

## The resolution

Contextual Bandit Algorithms are powerful when it comes to real-world applications such as marketing and personalized suggestion systems. With its online nature and its ability to learn and adapt with each reward, there becomes the possibility to entirely transform our decision-making processes. 

By implementing the Contextual Bandit Algorithm, we were able to optimally and dynamically allocate our online advertisements to create the perfect user experience for the varying users' behavior. Within minutes our client was happy, and we had another successful case solved for a happier client.

Thus, harnessing the true potential of the Contextual Bandit Algorithm in Python allowed us to solve this mystery and provided us with the satisfaction of delivering powerful results with our expertise.

## The Code Behind the Contextual Bandit Algorithm

In the case we just solved with Sherlock Holmes, we used the Contextual Bandit Algorithm to optimize the placement of online advertisements. The code used for this task was a simple implementation of the algorithm in Python. 

```python
class ContextualBandit:
    def __init__(self):
        self.theta = np.random.normal(0,1,[num_features, num_actions])
        
    def pull(self, x):
        values = np.dot(x, self.theta)
        action = np.argmax(values)
        return action
    
    def update(self, x, a, r):
        self.theta[:,a] += learning_rate*(r-np.dot(x,self.theta[:,a]))*x
```

Let's break down the code step by step: 

**1. Initialization**

```python
self.theta = np.random.normal(0,1,[num_features, num_actions])
```
The first step is to initialize the algorithm's parameters. Here, we're using a randomly generated NumPy array of `num_features` size, and `num_actions` to represent the action values.

**2. Action Selection**

```python
def pull(self, x):
    values = np.dot(x, self.theta)
    action = np.argmax(values)
    return action
```
The `pull` method is responsible for selecting the action to take. It accepts `x` as input, where `x` is a NumPy array of features or contexts for the given input. It returns the index for the action to take, which is the one with the highest expected reward based on the algorithm's current parameters.

**3. Updating Parameters**

```python
def update(self, x, a, r):
    self.theta[:,a] += learning_rate*(r-np.dot(x,self.theta[:,a]))*x
```

Finally, once the reward, action, and context are sent to the algorithm, the `update` function is called. This method takes three arguments - `x`, `a`, and `r`, which represent the context, action index, and reward, respectively. It updates the algorithm's parameters (in this case, the `theta` array) based on the values of `x`, `a`, and `r`.

By following this process, the algorithm can adapt to different users' behavior and optimize the best personalized ad experience for each user.

## Final thoughts

The Contextual Bandit Algorithm is a flexible and effective approach when it comes to online decision-making processes. It is simple to implement and can optimize actions based on feedback in real-time. With a basic understanding of the code, one can leverage the algorithm to solve complex real-world problems like the one we just solved.
