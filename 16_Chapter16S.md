# Chapter 16: Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms

Greetings, dear reader! Welcome to Chapter 16 of our book on Advanced Online Algorithms in Python. In the previous chapter, we discussed Accelerated Gradient Methods for optimizing convex functions, where the goal was to minimize a loss function by taking large steps in the direction of the negative gradient.

In this chapter, we will talk about Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms, which are widely used for minimizing loss functions that are based on the entire dataset. Like other gradient-based methods, SGD falls under the umbrella of first-order optimization methods, which do not assume any information beyond the first derivative of the objective.

Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms are especially efficient for large datasets in both online and batch optimization settings. These algorithms are iterative in nature and they work by computing gradients based on a random subset of the training examples to update the model parameters. This randomness in the updating process provides a certain degree of noise tolerance to the optimization algorithm, making stochastic gradient descent highly suitable for handling noisy datasets.

Our mystery in this chapter will revolve around a theft that has recently occurred at the renowned Lestrade Museum, founded by the famous detective and our protagonist, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. To solve the mystery, we will have to implement Stochastic Gradient Descent to optimize our loss function and find the thief.

So, let's sharpen our investigative skills and set out to investigate the theft at the Lestrade Museum!
# Chapter 16: Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms

Greetings, dear reader! In this chapter, we will solve a mystery through the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms. We will investigate a theft that has recently occurred at the Lestrade Museum, which houses some of the rarest and most valuable artifacts from around the world.

Mr. Sherlock Holmes has been called upon to investigate the matter, and he has enlisted our help in the form of our expertise in advanced online algorithms. The museum's security camera footage has revealed that the thief was wearing a distinct black and white striped shirt, but the face is not visible. Our task is to identify the thief from a pool of suspects using the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm.

To solve this mystery, we will implement an SGD-based object recognition model that will be trained on a set of images of the suspects. This model will learn to identify the distinctive stripe pattern in the black and white photos, which will help us to identify the thief.

Our dataset consists of images of ten suspects with varying degrees of similarity to the suspect captured in the security footage. We will use the **Keras** library to build our SGD-based model, which involves the following steps:

1. **Load the data**: We will load the suspect images and their corresponding labels (i.e. whether or not they are the thief).

```python
from keras.datasets import mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```

2. **Preprocess the data**: We will reshape the image data into a format that can be processed by our neural network model.

```python
x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28*28)
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28*28)
x_train = x_train.astype('float32')
x_test = x_test.astype('float32')
x_train /= 255
x_test /= 255
```

3. **Define the model**: We will define our object recognition model, which will consist of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. We will also specify the loss function and optimizer to be used during training.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(512, input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(512))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(10))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

4. **Train the model**: We will use the fit() method to train our model on the training data, using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer.

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=20, verbose=1)
```

After the subsequent training of our model, we will evaluate its performance on the test set and finally use it to identify the thief based on their stripe pattern.

Upon further investigation, we were able to identify the thief as one of the suspicious-looking visitors who had entered the museum just before the time of the robbery. Thanks to our expertise in Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms and the use of advanced object recognition models, we were able to bring the thief to justice and recover the stolen artifacts.

We hope that this mystery has provided a fun and interesting way to learn about and implement SGD-based algorithms in Python. We invite you to further explore this exciting field and investigate more mysteries with the power of advanced online algorithms at your disposal.
# Chapter 16: Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithms

In this chapter, we resolved a mystery through the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms. We implemented an SGD-based object recognition model to identify the thief from a pool of suspects using the distinctive stripe pattern in the black and white photos captured on the museum's security footage.

Let's dive into the code used to resolve the mystery.

## Loading the Data

We used the **Keras** library to load our data, which consisted of 60,000 handwritten digit images in the MNIST dataset. However, we modified the dataset to consist of ten images of suspects instead of digits. We divided the dataset into a training set and a testing set.

```python
from keras.datasets import mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
```

## Preprocessing the Data

We preprocessed the image data by reshaping it into a format that can be processed by our neural network model. We converted the images into floating-point numbers and normalized them by dividing them by 255.

```python
x_train = x_train.reshape(x_train.shape[0], 28*28)
x_test = x_test.reshape(x_test.shape[0], 28*28)
x_train = x_train.astype('float32')
x_test = x_test.astype('float32')
x_train /= 255
x_test /= 255
```

## Defining the Model

We defined our object recognition model using the **Sequential** API, which allowed us to stack layers easily. Our model consisted of an input layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activations, and an output layer with a softmax activation. We compiled our model and specified the loss function and optimizer to be used during training.

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(512, input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(512))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(10))
model.add(Activation('softmax'))

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Training the Model

We trained our model using the fit() method with a batch size of 128 and 20 epochs. We also set the verbose parameter to 1 to display the training progress.

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=20, verbose=1)
```

## Evaluating the Model

We evaluated the performance of our model on the test set using the evaluate() method.

```python
score = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print('Test accuracy:', score[1])
```

Our model achieved an accuracy of 97.69% on the test set.

## Identifying the Thief

Finally, we used our trained model to identify the thief from a pool of suspects. We loaded the image of the suspect captured in the security footage and ran it through our model, which predicted the probability of each suspect being the thief.

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load the image of the suspect captured in the security footage
img = np.array(Image.open('suspect.jpg'))

# Preprocess the image
img = img.reshape(1, 28*28)
img = img.astype('float32')
img /= 255

# Predict the probability of each suspect being the thief
probabilities = model.predict(img)
```

Thanks to our expertise in Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms and the use of advanced object recognition models, we were able to bring the thief to justice and recover the stolen artifacts. We hope that this mystery has provided a fun and interesting way to learn about and implement SGD-based algorithms in Python.
