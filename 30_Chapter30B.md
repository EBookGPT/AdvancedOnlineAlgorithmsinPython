# Chapter 30: Black-Box Online Optimization

As we immerse ourselves in the field of online algorithms, we look now at black-box online optimization. This chapter follows our previous exploration into online reinforcement learning, but with a different perspective.

Black-box optimization is the process of finding a solution to a complex system without knowledge or access to its internal workings. The algorithm is provided with only inputs and their corresponding outputs. Our task is to deduce the functional relationship and optimize accordingly.

In this chapter, we will apply online algorithms to black-box optimization problems in the context of dynamic systems. We will start by introducing the concept of online convex optimization, a powerful tool that allows us to achieve near-optimal results in many settings. We will then explore the application of stochastic gradient descent to the optimization of non-convex functions, making use of randomized search and sampling techniques to overcome local optima.

Through the lens of a thrilling Sherlock Holmes mystery, we will apply these concepts to solve a black-box optimization problem in a fast-paced and dynamic environment. Join us on this journey to solve the conundrum and master black-box optimization with Advanced Online Algorithms in Python!
# A Black-Box Conundrum

Sherlock Holmes, renowned detective, paced the room as he pondered the peculiar problem presented to him. The Royal Observatory of London had experienced a sudden glitch in their telescope control system. The engineers were baffled as to the cause of the issue, as the system ran smoothly until the glitch occurred.

As Holmes examined the system, he quickly realized that it was a black-box problem. He had no access to the internal workings of the system, only the inputs and the corresponding outputs. His task was to find a solution to the problem without any knowledge of the system internals.

Putting his mind to the task, Holmes applied online convex optimization to the problem at hand. He began by analyzing the inputs and outputs and using the principle of "online learning on the fly," he started to gradually improve his prediction function, which would help him to adequately control the telescope in the absence of a complete understanding of the system. Little by little, Sherlock's model started to fit the data, and the telescope was finally under control.

But this was not enough for Holmes. He believed that a more sophisticated optimization method could be applied to this problem. So he decided to use stochastic gradient descent to optimize the model. By randomizing his search and using probability distributions, he was able to find a deeper, more accurate analysis of the telescope control system.

Sherlock's investigation led him to a deep analysis of the telescope system, identifying that the issue was caused by a momentary power outage. Solving the black-box problem using online optimization methods, Sherlock was able to restore the system to its original working state.

As the case was closed, the Royal Observatory of London thanked Sherlock for his brilliant work, and the detective realized once again the fundamental importance of online algorithms in the real world.

And so, dear reader, we end our journey through black-box optimization, filled with its mysteries and conundrums, but also with the tools to solve them. Join us again as we venture through further applications of online algorithms in Python.
In our Sherlock Holmes mystery, we tackled the problem of black-box optimization with the help of online algorithms in Python. Let's see how we can use these algorithms to resolve the mystery.

First, we used online convex optimization to improve our prediction function. This was done by iteratively adapting to the incoming data and gradually improving the prediction function. The following sample code demonstrates how online convex optimization can be implemented in Python:

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def f(x):
    # function to optimize
    ...

x = [init_guess]
for i in range(n_iterations):
    # receive input/output pair
    input, output = get_input_output_pair()
    
    # define loss function as difference between prediction and output
    loss = lambda x: (f(x, input) - output)**2
    
    # update prediction using optimized value of x
    res = minimize(loss, x, method='nelder-mead', options={'xatol': 1e-8, 'disp': False})
    x = res.x
```

Next, we applied stochastic gradient descent to optimize the constrained black-box function. The following code demonstrates how this can be done using the `scikit-learn` package:

```python
from sklearn.utils import shuffle

def optimize_model(X, y, n_iterations, step_size):
    # initialize model parameters
    w = np.zeros(X.shape[1])
    for i in range(n_iterations):
        # shuffle data to reduce correlation
        X, y = shuffle(X, y)
        for j in range(X.shape[0]):
            # calculate gradient of loss function w.r.t. model parameters
            grad = calc_gradient(w, X[j], y[j])
            # update model parameters using stochastic gradient descent
            w -= step_size * grad
    return w
```

Through these methods, we were able to overcome the challenges of a black-box problem and restore the telescope control system to its original working state. With these techniques in hand, we are well-equipped to tackle many other online optimization problems that may arise in the future.
