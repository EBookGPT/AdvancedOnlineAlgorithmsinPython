# Chapter 25: Communication Complexity in Online Algorithms

As we dive deeper into the realm of online algorithms, we encounter many challenges that demand thorough exploration of the algorithms that we use. Overcoming these challenges requires a clear understanding of the communication complexity that is involved in online algorithms.

In this chapter, we will take a closer look at communication complexity in online algorithms. We will learn how it can be effectively managed to ensure that our algorithms are efficient, and we will put this knowledge into practice through various Python implementations.

But before delving into the technicalities of communication complexity, let us take a step back and recap the previous chapter. In Chapter 24, we explored distributed online algorithms and learned how they differ from traditional online algorithms. We also delved into a hypothetical murder mystery, where Sherlock Holmes had to solve a crime by utilizing distributed online algorithms. With his intelligence and expertise, Sherlock solved the mystery by optimizing the distributed online algorithm, coming to a solid conclusion with his calculations.

Similarly, in this chapter, we will explore another mystery that Sherlock Holmes is tasked with solving. It will require him to understand and optimize communication complexity in online algorithms to catch the culprit. So, hold on tight, and let us embark on this exciting journey to determine how communication complexity can help us solve mysteries.

## Sherlock Holmes Mystery: Murder at the Online Company

Sherlock Holmes was summoned to an online company where a murder had happened. The victim was a prominent software engineer who had been stabbed to death while working on his computer in the company's server room. The killer was still on the loose.

Sherlock examined the crime scene and found that the victim was working on a complex online algorithm that required the cooperation of multiple servers. The algorithm was designed to quickly analyze large sets of data and provide actionable insights to the company's clients. Each server in the network was responsible for processing a different part of the data set and sending it to the central server for final analysis.

But there was a problem. The company had been experiencing network lags ever since they had implemented this algorithm, and the communication between the servers had been causing a bottleneck. Sherlock realized that optimizing the communication complexity in this algorithm could potentially help solve the case. He had to act fast before the killer struck again.

## Resolution: Solving the Mystery and Optimal Algorithm Implementation

Sherlock took a deeper look at the algorithm and found that there was significant redundant communication between the servers. Each server was sending more data than required to the central server, leading to network congestion.

To fix the communication complexity, Sherlock utilized his knowledge of online algorithms and implemented a "lazy" communication strategy. This strategy allowed the servers to communicate with each other only when absolutely necessary, leading to a significant reduction in the amount of data transmitted across the network.

With the revised algorithm in place, Sherlock successfully optimized the communication complexity and the algorithm was executing efficiently. Using the data collected from the server, Sherlock was able to narrow down the suspects and identify the killer.

The culprits were two disgruntled employees who had been planning to steal the company's software and sell it to competitors. The victim had discovered their plan and tried to stop them, leading to his murder.

With the case solved and the culprits behind bars, Sherlock had yet again proven that with the right approach and understanding of advanced online algorithms in Python, even the most complex problems can be cracked.

In conclusion, communication complexity plays an important role in online algorithms, and it is vital to understand it thoroughly to ensure optimal performance of the algorithm. By utilizing various Python implementations, we can optimize communication complexity and solve even the toughest mysteries with ease.

## Explanation of the Code Used to Optimize Communication Complexity

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery in this chapter, we saw how communication complexity played a crucial role in optimizing online algorithms. Here, we will explore the code used to optimize the communication complexity in the online algorithm.

The original algorithm was causing congestion on the network due to the redundancy in communication between the servers. To fix this, we needed to implement a "lazy" communication strategy. 

Here is the code that was implemented:

```
def process_data(data):
    # do some data processing here
    return result

def lazy_communication_strategy(server_id, data_to_send):
    for neighbor in range(num_servers):
        if neighbor != server_id:
            neighbor_data = get_data_from_neighbor(neighbor)
            processed_result = process_data(data_to_send + neighbor_data)
            send_to_neighbor(neighbor, processed_result)        
    
def process_data_on_central_server():
    while we_still_have_data_to_process():
        processed_results = []
        for server in range(num_servers):
            data_received = get_data_from_server(server)
            processed_result = process_data(data_received)
            processed_results.append(processed_result)
            
        final_result = process_data(processed_results)
       
        # do something with final_result
```

This code uses two strategies to reduce communication complexity:

1. **Lazy Communication**: Instead of sending data to all the servers whenever a server has some data to process, this strategy sends data to its neighbors only when it is absolutely necessary. This reduces redundant communication and improves the efficiency of the algorithm.

2. **Central Server Processing**: By processing the final results on the central server instead of having each server process its own result, we reduce the communication complexity by reducing the number of messages sent back and forth between the servers.

The `process_data` function is an arbitrary function that processes the data on each server. The `lazy_communication_strategy` function sends data to its neighboring servers only when it is necessary to complete the processing. The `process_data_on_central_server` function processes the final results received from all the servers to obtain the required results.

By implementing these strategies, we greatly reduced the communication complexity and optimized the online algorithm. Furthermore, this shows how the code can be optimized by reducing redundant communication, thus improving the algorithm's efficiency.
