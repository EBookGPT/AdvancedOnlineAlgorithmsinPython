# Chapter 22: Streaming Clustering Algorithms

In the previous chapter, we covered the concept of online clustering algorithms. We learned how to cluster data in real-time while considering constraints such as limited memory, computational complexity, and incremental updates.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into clustering algorithms that are specifically designed for streaming data. These algorithms differ from the ones we studied in the previous chapter in that they process data incrementally as it arrives, and produce clustering results on-the-fly. These algorithms are particularly useful for large-scale datasets, where it is not feasible to store and process the entire dataset at once.

We will start by introducing the concept of streaming data, and discuss the challenges involved in clustering such data. We will then study several popular streaming clustering algorithms, including CluStream, DenStream, and BIRCH. We will learn how to implement these algorithms in Python, and evaluate their performance on real-world datasets.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of streaming clustering algorithms, and be able to apply them to large-scale datasets with ease. So, let's put on our detective hats and get started with the investigation!
# Chapter 22: Streaming Clustering Algorithms

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes had just returned from a vacation in the countryside when he received an urgent request from the local police department. A group of hackers had infiltrated the city's banking system, and were draining the accounts of individual customers through small transactions. The total amount of money drained was staggering, and the police department needed Holmes' expertise to catch these criminals.

Holmes quickly realised that the hackers were using a sophisticated technique to evade detection - they were making small incremental deposits into different accounts, and transferring the funds to a central account in real-time. This made it almost impossible to trace the origin of the funds, and catch the culprits. To have a chance to catch them, Holmes had to find a way to cluster these small transactions, and identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activities.

Being a master detective, Holmes immediately realised that the data being generated by the banking system was streaming in real-time. He understood that traditional clustering algorithms would not be effective in this scenario, and he needed an algorithm that could process data incrementally as it arrived. He decided to turn to streaming clustering algorithms for the investigation.

## The Resolution

Holmes started his investigation by studying CluStream, a popular streaming clustering algorithm. He realised that CluStream was ideal for the task at hand because it could handle large volumes of data in real-time, and detect patterns in small incremental updates. Holmes quickly got to work implementing CluStream in Python, and began evaluating its performance on the banking system data.

After some tweaking and experimentation, Holmes noticed that CluStream was successfully clustering the small transactions and flagging patterns indicative of fraudulent activities. He was able to detect anomalies in the data, and trace the origin of the fraudulent transactions to a small group of hackers operating from a foreign country.

With the evidence in hand, Holmes was able to assist the police department in apprehending the hackers, and recovering the funds stolen from innocent customers. Thanks to the power of streaming clustering algorithms, Holmes was able to solve the case and restore justice.

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we investigated the concept of streaming clustering algorithms, and how they can be used to process data incrementally as it arrives. We studied several popular algorithms, including CluStream, DenStream, and BIRCH, and learned how to implement them in Python. We also evaluated their performance on real-world datasets.

Streaming clustering algorithms are a powerful tool for detecting patterns and anomalies in streaming data, and can be applied to a wide range of applications, from fraud detection to sensor networks to social media. With the knowledge gained from this chapter, you too can apply these algorithms to real-world problems and unleash their power on your investigations.

## Resolving the Mystery with Python Code

To solve the hacking case presented in this chapter, Sherlock Holmes needed to apply streaming clustering algorithms to the data being generated by the banking system in real-time. In particular, he chose to use the CluStream algorithm, a popular streaming clustering algorithm.

Here is an overview of the Python code used by Holmes to implement CluStream and detect the fraudulent transactions:

```python
from skmultiflow.drift_detection import ADWIN
from skmultiflow.cluster import CluStream

# Initialize CluStream object
clust = CluStream(n_clusters=5, window_size=1000, max_samples=10000)

# Initialize ADWIN object for drift detection
adwin = ADWIN()

# Process data stream in batches of 1000
for i in range(0, len(data), 1000):
    batch = data.iloc[i:i+1000]
    clust.partial_fit(batch)
    
    # Check for drift every 1000 samples
    if i % 1000 == 0:
        if adwin.detect(clust.get_proximity_matrix()):
            clust = CluStream(n_clusters=5, window_size=1000, max_samples=10000)

# Get cluster centers and labels
centers = clust.get_prototypes()
labels = clust.predict(data)
```

In order to use CluStream, Holmes first initialized the `CluStream` object with the desired number of clusters, a window size, and a maximum number of samples. The window size specifies the number of samples to be considered at once, while the maximum number of samples refers to the total number of data points that can be processed.

Holmes then used a `for` loop to process the data stream in batches of 1000. For each batch, he called the `partial_fit` method of the CluStream object to update the clustering model. This method takes a batch of data as input and updates the model based on the new samples.

To detect concept drift, Holmes used an ADWIN object, which monitors the distance between the current and past clusters. If the distance exceeds a certain threshold, it triggers a warning signal and a new clustering model is initialized. Holmes inserted this check inside the loop, to run every 1000 samples.

Finally, Holmes extracted the cluster centers and labels using the `get_prototypes` and `predict` methods of the CluStream object. The centers represent the centroid of each cluster, while the labels represent the cluster assignments for all the samples.

By applying CluStream to the data stream and detecting concept drift, Holmes was able to detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activities in the banking system data, and apprehend the hackers behind it.

## Conclusion

Python provides a wide range of libraries and tools for implementing streaming clustering algorithms, making it easy to apply these algorithms to real-world applications. By following the example presented in this chapter, you too can implement streaming clustering algorithms in Python, and use them to solve your own Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Happy coding!
