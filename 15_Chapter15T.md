# Chapter 15: The Mysterious Disappearance and The Hunt for Accelerated Gradient Methods

**It was an incredibly hot day in London and the only thing that troubled the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes, was the disappearance of Sashank J. Reddi - an expert in online algorithms. Reddi had been investigating the most recent advancements in gradient descent algorithms and had begun to explore accelerated gradient methods before his sudden disappearance left the investigation at a standstill.**

As Sherlock Holmes dug deeper into the case, he began to unravel the mystery behind the disappearance. Without hesitation, Holmes began to apply the most advanced online algorithms in Python to decrypt a code diary that Reddi had been keeping.

It soon became apparent that Reddi had been working on a new type of optimization algorithm called *Accelerated Gradient Methods*, which promised to revolutionize the way we think about online algorithms. These methods improve upon the standard gradient descent techniques used by online algorithms by utilizing *momentum*, which helps to prevent gradients from oscillating in areas of flat curvature.

In this chapter, we will follow in the footsteps of Holmes and uncover the secrets of accelerated gradient methods, as well as its practical applications in Python code. We will explore how they differ from standard gradient descent algorithms and how they can be adapted to improve the optimization of complex functions.  

Are you up for the challenge to help Sherlock Holmes solve this mysterious disappearance, and master the advanced online algorithms of Python? Let's jump right in!
# Chapter 15: The Mysterious Disappearance and The Hunt for Accelerated Gradient Methods

**It was an incredibly hot day in London and the only thing that troubled the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes, was the disappearance of Sashank J. Reddi - an expert in online algorithms. Reddi had been investigating the most recent advancements in gradient descent algorithms and had begun to explore accelerated gradient methods before his sudden disappearance left the investigation at a standstill.**

As Holmes put his mind to unravel the cause of this baffling case, he recalled Reddi's research on Accelerated Gradient Methods. With the help of Dr. John Watson, Holmes attempted to contact Reddi's colleagues, his family members, and anyone who was knowledgeable about his recent activities. Yet, there was no sign of Reddi, and the case seemed to lead to a dead-end. 

In one of the few notes that were found in Reddi's lab, there was mention of a significant finding in the realm of online optimization techniques. The note mentioned the usage of *Nesterov's accelerated gradient* method, which provides a solution up to 2x faster than the conventional method, Gradient Descent. 

After a long day of investigation, Holmes began to see the relationship between Reddi's disappearance and his research on Accelerated Gradient Methods. Holmes suspected that Reddi had unlocked something revolutionary in his research, and that certain individuals had taken issue with this progress. 

Without hesitation, Holmes began applying his vast knowledge of advanced online algorithms in Python. He decided to put the *Nesterov's accelerated gradient* method to the test and reverse-engineer the problem by looking at the gradient of the loss function.  Holmes put this to practical use by finding the hardest problem in the book and preparing to solve it with this ingenious algorithm. 

In no time, Holmes was able to solve the problem with unprecedented speed, a function that would have taken an hour to optimize with regular gradient descent was efficiently executed with the *Nesterov's accelerated gradient* method.

As the case unfolded, Holmes discovered that Reddi was indeed in danger. It appeared that a group of powerful individuals had become aware of Reddi's promising results and sought to prevent his work from becoming known to the public. Holmes and Watson gathered evidence and traced the group’s movements using advanced network algorithms.

After a swift and expansive investigation, Holmes finally found Reddi near an abandoned warehouse. They had injected Reddi with a drug that caused him to lose his memory temporarily. 

With the use of Python's advanced online algorithms, Holmes was able to come to Reddi's aid and retrieve his important findings. Holmes applied his knowledge of *Nesterov's accelerated gradient* method to decode the encrypted memo, and discovered that Reddi had indeed created a new benchmark for online optimization algorithms. 

The group who had abducted Reddi was subsequently arrested and charged with several offenses, and Reddi was given the credit he deserved for his groundbreaking work.

With the integration of *Nesterov's accelerated gradient* method in his toolkit of online algorithms, Holmes was able to solve this case and unlock new knowledge to bring his investigations to the next level. The application of advanced online algorithms in Python saved the day yet again!
Throughout the chapter, Sherlock Holmes utilized various advanced online algorithms to solve the case of Sashank J. Reddi's disappearance. One of the key algorithms that helped Holmes solve this case was *Nesterov's accelerated gradient* method. 

## Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method

Nesterov's accelerated gradient is an optimization algorithm that is designed to improve the convergence rate of the gradient descent algorithm. The core idea behind this method is to use the gradient's momentum to move towards the minimum more quickly. 

The algorithm's momentum term serves to dampen the oscillations that often arise when training deep networks, while the proximal operator is used to impose structure on estimates of ´ but ensuring they lie within a certain set. This results in the algorithm being able to perform its task by achieving convergence up to 2x faster than standard gradient descent algorithms.

The formula for updating the gradient using Nesterov's accelerated gradient method is given below:

```python
# Initialize parameters
theta = 0
lr = 0.001
mu = 0.9

# Initialize momentum vector
v = 0 

# Perform optimization
while True:
    # Calculate gradient
    grad = calculate_gradient(x)
    # Update momentum vector
    v = mu * v - lr * grad
    # Update gradient
    theta = theta + mu * mu * v - (1 + mu) * lr * grad
    
    ...
```

The above code snippet outlines the general steps for using Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for optimization tasks. It includes initialization of parameters, such as the learning rate and momentum term, as well as the momentum vector. The algorithm then computes the gradient and updates the momentum vector, which is later used to update the gradient by correcting for the overshoot that the momentum can introduce.  Sherlock Holmes leveraged this technique to solve the problem of optimization that arose in his investigation.

## Solving the Case

As outlined in the chapter, Holmes utilized Nesterov's accelerated gradient to optimize the loss function and crack the code that lead to the location of Reddi. With the inclusion of this algorithm to his toolkit of online algorithms, Holmes was able to effectively solve the case and bring the culprits to justice.

The plight of Sashank J. Reddi would have remained a mystery, were it not for the utilization of advanced online algorithms in Python; these algorithms helped Sherlock Holmes track down the perpetrators of this heinous crime and, in so doing, bolstered his knowledge of optimization algorithms to a new level.
