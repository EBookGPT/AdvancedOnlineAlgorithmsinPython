# Chapter 18: Weighted Majority Algorithms

Welcome back dear readers, it's time to delve into another exciting chapter. After learning about online learning with expert advice in our previous chapter, we are going to explore a related topic of Weighted Majority Algorithms.

To help us understand this topic in a better way, we have a special guest, Sebastian Thrun. Thrun is the founder of Google X, Google's self-driving car team, and the co-founder of Udacity, an online education platform. He is also a professor of computer science at Stanford University and a research professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

Intrigued? Let's dive in and see how this algorithm works and what makes it so important in the world of online learning.

But first, let's understand the term "Weighted Majority Algorithms". This algorithm is a method of selecting the most popular choice based on the highest weightage achieved by each option. It is commonly used in machine learning settings, where it is used for classification problems. The goal is to make accurate predictions based on the majority of the 'votes' given by the hypothesis set.

In the next few pages, Sebastian Thrun will help us understand the concepts of Weighted Majority Algorithm, and we will walk you through the mathematical details of its implementation. So buckle up and get ready to learn!

# Chapter 18: Weighted Majority Algorithms

It was a dark and stormy night when Sherlock Holmes received a perplexing letter. The letter was written by a prominent businessman, Mr. John Smith. Mr. Smith was facing a problem in his business, and he hoped that Holmes could solve it. The letter read:

"Dear Mr. Holmes,

I'm in desperate need of your assistance. My business has been experiencing a downturn, and I can't seem to figure out why. I have reason to believe that someone is sabotaging my business by providing false information to my customers. I need your help to find out who is doing this, and how they're doing it.

Sincerely,
John Smith"

Holmes realized that this was no ordinary task. He immediately took the case and called upon Sebastian Thrun to assist him.

After conducting an initial investigation, Sebastian Thrun noted that the business had recently undergone some changes, and the customers were complaining that the quality of service had gone down.

Upon further investigation, they discovered that there was indeed someone who was intentionally providing false information to the customers via online platforms. This, in turn, was affecting the quality of service delivery, thereby, causing a drop in business revenue.

Holmes and Thrun formulated a plan to put an end to the malicious actor by leveraging an online learning algorithm - The Weighted Majority Algorithm.

The algorithm worked by assigning a weightage to each hypothesis based on its success or failure in predicting the outcome. The hypothesis with the highest weightage was then selected as the outcome. Holmes and Thrun utilized the algorithm to classify the correct information that should be provided to the customers and removed any false information given. By applying the weighted sum of these classified informations, John's team delivered the best quality service to their customers and regained their confidence.

The business began to recover, and the culprit attempting to undermine Mr. Smith's business was caught, tried and convicted. The Weighted Majority Algorithm played a crucial part in catching and convicting the individual who was causing harm to the business.

Thanks to the combined effort of Mr. Holmes and Sebastian Thrun, the mystery of the false information provider was solved, and they helped revive the business of Mr. John Smith.

The Weighted Majority Algorithm played a critical role in solving the mystery in this chapter. Let's dive a bit deeper into the code used in the solution:

```python
# We begin by initializing weights for each hypothesis
weights = [1] * num_hypotheses

# Next, we iterate through a set of classified data and adjust the weights based on how successful each hypothesis was in classifying the data
for data in classified_data:
    for i, hypothesis in enumerate(hypotheses):
        if hypothesis.classify(data) == data.label:
            weights[i] = weights[i] * (1 - learning_rate)
        else:
            weights[i] = weights[i] * (1 + learning_rate)

# Finally, we select the hypothesis with the highest weightage as the outcome
final_hypothesis = hypotheses[weights.index(max(weights))]
```

The code above initializes the weights of the hypotheses as an array of ones. Then, it adjusts those weights based on how successful each hypothesis was in classifying the data. If a hypothesis correctly classifies data, its weight is decreased, and if it incorrectly classifies data, its weight is increased. This way, the algorithm gives more weight to the hypotheses that are more accurate.

In the end, the algorithm selects the hypothesis with the highest weightage as the final hypothesis.

This algorithm allows us to effectively classify and predict outcomes in a variety of classification problems. Its ability to adapt and learn from new data, makes it particularly useful in dynamic environments.

In this chapter's Sherlock Holmes mystery, the algorithm was used to classify correct and false information given to the customers, thereby identifying the culprit behind the downtrend in Mr. John Smith's business. Through this illustration, we can see why the Weighted Majority Algorithm is so important in the world of online learning.
