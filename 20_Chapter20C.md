# Chapter 20: Calibration Algorithms 

Greetings, dear reader! It is my pleasure to introduce you to the world of Calibration Algorithms â€“ a world where data science meets machine learning, and the need for accurate prediction measures keeps us on our toes.

In the previous chapter, we delved into the world of Hedge Algorithms, which aimed to balance trade-offs between exploitative and explorative strategies to minimize regret. However, our journey through the realm of online algorithms continues, bringing us face to face with the intriguing concept of Calibration Algorithms.

This chapter will explore the intricacies of calibration, the process of fine-tuning probabilistic predictors to provide accurate predictions. At the heart of this topic is the fundamental question: "How well calibrated are your predictions?"

Here to guide you through the ins and outs of calibration is none other than the revered Vladimir Vapnik. Dr. Vapnik is a renowned computer scientist who developed the support vector machine (SVM) and the theory of Vapnik-Chervonenkis classes, which laid the foundation for statistical learning theory. He brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to our investigation of Calibration Algorithms.

As we unravel the mystery of Calibration Algorithms, we will explore various techniques for calibration such as Platt Scaling, Temperature Scaling, Isotonic Regression, and Covariate Shift Adaptation. We will also delve into topics such as multinomial calibration, hierarchical classification, and many more.

So, until we meet again, take a deep breath and brace yourself for the fascinating journey that awaits us in the realm of Calibration Algorithms!
# Chapter 20: Calibration Algorithms

Sherlock Holmes and his assistant, Dr. Watson, were once again summoned to Scotland Yard. Inspector Lestrade had a puzzling case for them to solve.

A local bank had a model for predicting whether a loan applicant would default on their loan or not. The model predicted a probability for each applicant, but the bank had noticed that the predicted probabilities were often incorrect. The results of the model were skewed, leading to unexpected outcomes. The inspector believed this to be a problem of calibration, and he asked Holmes to investigate.

Holmes immediately started working on the case. He gathered data from the bank about the loan applicants and analyzed the predictions made by the model. He found that the probabilities predicted by the model were not well calibrated - the model predicted much higher probabilities of default than what was actually observed.

Dr. Watson suggested using Platt Scaling to calibrate the model's predictions. Holmes nodded his approval and they immediately got to work. They divided the loan applicants into training and testing sets and trained the model using the training set. They then applied Platt Scaling to the probabilities predicted by the model for the testing set.

```
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

# divide data into training and testing sets
train_data, train_targets = ..., ...
test_data, test_targets = ..., ...

# train a logistic regression model on the training data
lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(train_data, train_targets)

# apply Platt scaling to calibrate model probabilities on test data
calibrated_lr = CalibratedClassifierCV(lr, cv='prefit')
calibrated_lr.fit(test_data, test_targets)
calibrated_probas = calibrated_lr.predict_proba(test_data)
```

Holmes and Watson examined the outcome of Platt Scaling and found that the model's predicted probabilities were now well-calibrated. The predicted probabilities now reflected the true probabilities of default more accurately than before. The mystery of the skewed loan outcomes was solved!

Just as they were finishing up, the door opened and in walked the respected computer scientist, Vladimir Vapnik. He had heard of their investigation and wanted to offer his expertise. He congratulated Holmes and Watson on their successful use of Platt Scaling, but mentioned that there were other techniques for calibration like Temperature Scaling, Isotonic Regression, and Covariate Shift Adaptation, each with its own strengths.

Holmes, intrigued by Vapnik's knowledge, decided to dive deeper into Calibration Algorithms, exploring all the various techniques available. With Vladimir Vapnik by their side, they embarked on an exciting journey into the realm of online algorithms, their mysteries unraveling with each step.
To resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery related to poorly calibrated model predictions, Holmes and Watson decided to use the Platt Scaling technique. The code used to accomplish this is shown below for reference.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

# divide data into training and testing sets
train_data, train_targets = ..., ...
test_data, test_targets = ..., ...

# train a logistic regression model on the training data
lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(train_data, train_targets)

# apply Platt scaling to calibrate model probabilities on test data
calibrated_lr = CalibratedClassifierCV(lr, cv='prefit')
calibrated_lr.fit(test_data, test_targets)
calibrated_probas = calibrated_lr.predict_proba(test_data)
```

The code makes use of the scikit-learn library, which offers several tools for calibrating model predictions. The code begins by dividing the data into train and test sets, which is a standard practice in machine learning.

Next, a logistic regression model is trained on the training data. Logistic regression is a common method for binary classification problems and its flexibility and simplicity make it an ideal choice for many cases.

Once the model is trained, Platt Scaling is applied to calibrate the model probabilities for the test data. Platt Scaling adjusts the model predictions to produce calibrated probabilities that are consistent with the true probabilities. This is accomplished by training a secondary logistic regression model on the original model predictions and the true outcomes, using cross-validation to select the best regularization parameter.

The `CalibratedClassifierCV` class is a convenient way to apply Platt Scaling or isotonic regression to any classifier that implements `predict_proba()`, like the logistic regression model in this case. 

Once the data is fit by this class, then it can be used to predict the calibrated probabilities using `predict_proba()`. 

In summary, the code uses logistic regression to train a binary classification model, and applies Platt Scaling to calibrate the model probabilities to produce more accurate predictions. Thanks to this, Sherlock and Watson were able to solve the mystery that had them puzzled, while Vladimir Vapnik encouraged Holmes to keep exploring other calibration techniques available.
