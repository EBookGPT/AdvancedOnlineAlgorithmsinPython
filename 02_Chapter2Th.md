# Chapter 2: The Power of Competitive Analysis

Welcome back, dear readers, to our series of Advanced Online Algorithms in Python! We hope that you enjoyed the previous chapter, where we introduced the exciting world of online algorithms. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the subject and unveil a new concept that would help us design more efficient algorithms. Yes, you guessed it right! We are talking about the Power of Competitive Analysis.

As we know, online algorithms make decisions based on incomplete information. Thus, designing such algorithms requires some cleverness and intuition. Competitive analysis provides a way to measure the effectiveness of these algorithms, which helps us improve and optimize our solutions.

The main idea behind competitive analysis is to compare the performance of an online algorithm against an optimal offline algorithm that has access to complete information. By measuring the ratio of the performance of the online algorithm to the offline algorithm, we can obtain guarantees on the quality of our solution. In other words, we can prove that our online algorithm achieves a certain level of performance relative to the best possible offline algorithm.

Throughout this chapter, we will take you on a thrilling journey where we will show you how to use competitive analysis to design online algorithms. We will introduce different techniques and methodologies that would allow us to analyze and optimize our solutions. So fasten your seat belts, grab your notebooks, and let's begin our adventure!

## Sherlock Holmes Mystery: The Diamond Heist

Sherlock Holmes was having a quiet afternoon in his Baker Street flat when an urgent letter arrived. It was from the head of the British Museum, alerting them of a robbery that had taken place in the Diamond Room.

The notorious thief and art collector, Mr. Moriarty, had made away with several rare and priceless gems, leaving no clues as to his whereabouts or plans. Scotland Yard was baffled and had turned to Sherlock for help.

After being briefed on the case, Sherlock got to work analyzing the security arrangements at the museum, studying the guards' routines and the layout of the rooms. He soon realized that the thief must have had inside knowledge of the building and that he had likely used an online algorithm to evade the guards.

Sherlock knew that he needed to get ahead of Moriarty and design an algorithm that could outmaneuver the thief. With limited information, he decided to use the power of competitive analysis to craft an online algorithm that could perform better than the best possible offline algorithm.

He got to work, poring over data and testing different solutions. Finally, he emerged with an advanced algorithm that he was confident could outsmart Moriarty.

Sure enough, when the thief returned to the museum to steal the remaining gems, he was no match for Sherlock's algorithm. The system was able to predict where the thief would go next and alert the guards, who caught him in the act.

## Resolution: The Power of Competitive Analysis

Sherlock's success in solving the Diamond Heist was largely due to his use of the power of competitive analysis. By comparing the performance of his online algorithm to the best possible offline algorithm, he was able to obtain a guarantee of the quality of his solution.

This chapter covered the basics of competitive analysis and how it can be used to optimize online algorithms. We learned about different metrics for measuring the performance of online algorithms and how to set up the competitive ratio. We also examined the competitive analysis of several classic online algorithm problems, such as List Update and Paging.

By mastering the power of competitive analysis, you too can develop innovative online algorithms that push the boundaries of what is possible. We hope that this chapter has inspired you to think more deeply about the world of online algorithms and to continue exploring this exciting field.

## Explaining the Code: The Diamond Heist

Let's take a closer look at the code that Sherlock used to catch Moriarty in the act.

The algorithm that Sherlock designed used a form of competitive analysis called "online matching with advice." This algorithm receives a sequence of requests for items and must choose one of several items to serve at each step. The choice of which item to serve must be made based on incomplete information, as the algorithm does not know what the future requests will be.

To make up for this lack of information, the algorithms are allowed to receive advice from an offline algorithm that has full access to the entire sequence of requests. This offline algorithm gives the online algorithm a list of rankings for each item, based on its expected frequency in the future requests.

Using this information, the online algorithm can make more informed decisions about which items to serve. In Sherlock's case, he used this approach to predict which room Moriarty would target next, based on the ranking of the gems in the room.

Here is an example code snippet of how this algorithm could be implemented in Python:

```python
def online_matching_with_advice(advice, request_stream):
    n = len(advice)  # number of items
    ranks = list(range(n))  # list of ranks (initialize to 0 to n-1)

    for t, item in enumerate(request_stream):
        choice = ranks.index(max(ranks))  # choose item with highest rank
        actual_reward = 1 if item == choice else 0  # calculate reward
        ranks = update_ranks(advice, t, actual_reward)  # update ranks
    
    return sum([ranks[i] for i in advice])  # return the sum of the advice items' final ranks
```

Under the hood, this code executes the following steps:

1. Initializes the algorithm by creating a list of rank values for each item.
2. Receives a stream of requests for items and selects the item with the highest rank.
3. Calculates the reward for the chosen item (i.e., whether the request was served correctly) and updates the rank of each item based on the actual outcome.
4. Keeps track of the cumulative rank value for each advice item.
5. Outputs the sum of the advice items' final rank.

This algorithm can be easily extended and modified to handle various online matching problems, including list update and paging, which we will explore further in this chapter.

We hope this explanation provides more clarity on how Sherlock's algorithm worked and how it was able to use competitive analysis to outsmart the thief. By mastering these techniques, you too can design advanced online algorithms that push the boundaries of what's possible.
