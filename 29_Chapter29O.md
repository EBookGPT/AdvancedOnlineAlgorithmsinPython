# Chapter 29: Online Reinforcement Learning

Welcome back, dear reader! In the last chapter, we explored the intriguing world of Bayesian Online Learning. Now, we shall delve into a different aspect of online learning, i.e., Reinforcement Learning.

Reinforcement Learning is one of the most fascinating fields of machine learning as it enables an agent to learn by interacting with its environment. This type of learning involves defining various states and rewards for a specific set of actions taken by the agent.

In this chapter, we'll make use of Python to implement an online Reinforcement Learning algorithm that will help us solve a mysterious case that has left Sherlock and Watson scratching their heads. So, grab your detective hats, and let's jump into this exciting adventure.

## The Case of the Missing Artifact

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson were enjoying a quiet afternoon when they were interrupted by a museum curator. The curator reported the theft of an ancient artifact from the museum. The artifact, a valuable Egyptian relic, was securely locked away in a display case, yet it had vanished without a trace.

Sherlock Holmes, being the brilliant detective that he is, quickly took the case. The thief had left no clues, and the police had no leads. The only way to solve this mystery was to think like the thief.

Holmes studied the museum's security footage and noticed something strange. He saw that the thief had walked through the museum, stopping and looking directly at the artifact before continuing on. This meant that the thief knew what they were after and had likely cased the museum beforehand.

Holmes knew that the only way to catch the thief was to create a simulation that would predict the likelihood of them coming back for the same piece. He considered using Reinforcement Learning, specifically the Q-Learning algorithm, to help the museum increase security and catch the thief.

He immediately set to work on creating the simulation. For the states, he used the various security measures around the museum, such as motion sensors and security cameras. The actions were the different security protocols that could be put in place, such as adding more security guards or increasing the number of cameras.

Using Python and the Q-Learning algorithm, Holmes trained the simulation and tested it on past museum data. After a few iterations, the simulation showed that the most effective protocol was to add more security guards in the room containing the artifact.

Holmes relayed this information to the museum, and they implemented the new protocol. A few days later, the thief returned to the museum, attempting to steal the artifact once again. With the new security protocol in place, the thief was caught in the act, and the artifact was returned to the museum.

Once again, the genius of Sherlock Holmes and the power of Python and Reinforcement Learning saved the day.


## Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored the exciting world of Online Reinforcement Learning through the eyes of the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes.

We implemented a Q-Learning algorithm in Python to create a simulation that helped solve the Mystery of the Missing Artifact. Reinforcement Learning is a powerful tool that can be used in various domains, including robotics, gaming, and finance.

We hope that this chapter has not only entertained you with a thrilling mystery but also sparked your curiosity in exploring the vast possibilities that Advanced Online Algorithms, like Reinforcement Learning, offer.

## Explaining the Code

In the case of the missing artifact, Sherlock Holmes used Reinforcement Learning to create a simulation that would predict the likelihood of the thief coming back for the same piece. More specifically, he used the Q-Learning algorithm.

Q-Learning is a model-free algorithm used in Reinforcement Learning. The goal of Q-Learning is to find an optimal policy for an agent in a given environment by learning an action-value function (Q-function) that maps a state-action pair to a value that represents the expected utility of taking that action while in that state.

The Q-Learning algorithm used in this case had the following components:

- The state space represented various security measures around the museum such as motion sensors and security cameras.

- The action space was defined by the different security protocols that could be put in place such as adding more security guards or increasing the number of cameras.

- The reward signal was defined as the value of the artifact.

To implement the Q-Learning algorithm, we used Python's NumPy library to create and manipulate arrays, and Matplotlib library to visualize the results. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize Q-Table with zeros
num_states = 100
num_actions = 10
q_table = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))

# Define hyperparameters
epsilon = 0.3
alpha = 0.2
gamma = 0.9

# Define the reward function 
def reward(state, action):
    # Returns the reward of taking the given action in the given state
    ...

# Train the Q-Learning algorithm
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    # Initialize the state
    state = ...
    
    # Loop until the episode is over
    while not done:
        # Choose an action using an epsilon-greedy policy
        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < epsilon:
            action = np.random.randint(0, num_actions)
        else:
            action = np.argmax(q_table[state, :])
        
        # Execute the action and observe the reward and next state
        next_state, reward, done = ...
        
        # Update the Q-Table
        q_table[state, action] = (1 - alpha) * q_table[state, action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(q_table[next_state, :]))
        
        # Update the state
        state = next_state

# Visualize the Q-Table
plt.imshow(q_table, cmap='hot', interpolation='nearest')
```

This code initializes the Q-Table with zeros, defines the hyperparameters such as the exploration rate (`epsilon`), the learning rate (`alpha`), and the discount factor(`gamma`), and trains the Q-Learning algorithm over a set number of episodes.

Once the Q-Learning algorithm has been trained, the Q-Table can be visualized using a heatmap to show the expected utility of each action in each state.

Overall, this example code demonstrates how Python can be used to implement the Q-Learning algorithm and create simulations using Reinforcement Learning.
