# Chapter 11: Deterministic Online Convex Optimization

After delving into the intricacies of Non-Stochastic Bandits, we now move onto our next exciting topic for the day, Deterministic Online Convex Optimization. This is an exciting field of study which involves decision-making, optimization and data science to a great extent. 

In simple terms, Deterministic Online Convex Optimization refers to the process whereby an algorithm chooses a vector from a convex set of allowable cost vectors at each point of time given contraints. The optimization of the vector takes place online as the constraints may change from time to time. This field of study is widely applied in gaming, finance and control systems among other areas.

In the subsequent sections of our chapter, we will cover the following:

1. The Concept of Convex Optimization: In this section, we will be looking at the foundational ideas of Convex Optimization and how they are applied in this field. 

2. The Notion of Deterministic Convex Optimization: In this section, we will be exploring the determinant components of this field including the conditions required for deterministic optimization. 

3. Online Convex Optimization: In this section, we will be taking a closer look at online optimization and the algorithms used to achieve the best results.

We hope you enjoy reading this chapter and also learn how to utilize Deterministic Online Convex Optimization to the best of your ability to ensure successful and efficient data analysis.

## The Curious Case of the Stolen Jewel

Sherlock Holmes was in a deep state of contemplation when Inspector Lestrade stepped into the room, throwing his coat onto Holmes' chaise longue. "Good grief, Holmes, what has gotten into you?" exclaimed Lestrade.

"Ah, Inspector Lestrade, I can see you're early," said Holmes. "I'm deep in thought. The problem we face is quite complex."

"What problem?" questioned Lestrade, arching his eyebrow.

"The matter of the stolen jewel from the Park Lane Museum," replied Holmes.

"Aha!" exclaimed Lestrade. "I must say, Holmes, that I'm perplexed by this case. There are no witnesses and no evidence I can find." 

"Your concerns are understandable," replied Holmes. "But you forget, Inspector, that in a case such as this, the true evidence is not so apparent."

"And what do you suggest?" asked Lestrade, skeptically.

Holmes took his seat and began to explain his thought process. "I suggest we apply Deterministic Online Convex Optimization. By examining the choices made by the thief and how the constraints were managed, we can reach a suitable solution."

Lestrade was taken aback by Holmesâ€™ suggestion. "I don't understand," he exclaimed.

"It's quite simple," replied Holmes. "The thief's choices have followed a certain pattern. By analyzing them, we can predict the next course of action and catch him in the act."

Holmes set to work, studying the surveillance footage and running his algorithm to identify the pattern of the thief's behavior. By mapping out the thief's possible next steps, Holmes and Lestrade were able to catch him red-handed.

## Resolution

As they walked back to 221B Baker Street, Lestrade marveled at the efficacy of the online optimization algorithm used by Holmes. "I must say, Holmes, you are a master of more than just deduction." 

"It's quite simple when you know how to use it," said Holmes. "As I said, you just need to recognize the pattern."

Lestrade was impressed by the power of Deterministic Online Convex Optimization and asked Holmes to teach him more. And so, the two parted ways, with Holmes continuing his work in the world of optimization, and Lestrade eager to learn more about this fascinating field of study.

## The Curious Case of the Stolen Jewel

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, Deterministic Online Convex Optimization was used to solve the case of a stolen jewel from the Park Lane Museum. Holmes used an algorithm to analyze the thief's behavior and predict their next move. Here's how the code worked in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def online_optimization(data):
  alpha = 0.1  # step size parameter
  x = np.zeros(data.shape[1])  # initialize variable vector to 0

  for i in range(data.shape[0]):
    y = data[i, :-1]  # choose vector from convex set
    loss = data[i, -1]  # calculate loss
    x = x - alpha * loss * y  # update variable vector

  return x
```

This function takes a dataset, where the last column is the loss parameter, and optimizes the variable vector using an online optimization algorithm. The `alpha` parameter is a step size parameter that tells the algorithm how much to update the variable vector at each iteration. The `x` vector is initialized to zero and is updated based on the loss and the chosen convex vector `y`. The algorithm continues to update the variable vector until it has converged to a minimum. 

In the mystery, Holmes used this algorithm to analyze the thief's previous actions, which were encoded in the dataset `data`. By running the algorithm on the dataset, Holmes was able to determine the pattern of the thief's behavior and predict their next move. The power of Deterministic Online Convex Optimization allowed Holmes to solve the case and catch the thief. 

This code demonstrates the power of online optimization in solving complex problems and predicting outcomes. By applying this technique, we can make efficient and highly accurate decisions based on previous patterns, constraints and data constraints.
