# Chapter 27: Online Markov Decision Processes

Welcome back, fellow detectives! I hope you enjoyed our last adventure on Online Linear Programming. Today, we will embark on a new adventure and tackle another exciting topic called Online Markov Decision Processes. 

In our previous chapters, we had focused on solving optimization problems under some constraints. But what if our problem involves making decisions in a dynamic environment where the outcomes are uncertain? This is where Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) come into play. 

MDPs are mathematical models used to capture decision-making problems where outcomes are uncertain, but can be influenced by the actions taken by an agent in a dynamic environment. This makes MDPs a popular tool for modeling a wide range of real-world problems. 

In this chapter, we will investigate how to solve these decision-making problems in an online setting, where the agent must make decisions without any prior knowledge of the environment. We will apply powerful algorithms in Python that enable efficient learning and decision-making in an MDP. 

So, get ready to explore new techniques and unravel the mysteries of Online Markov Decision Processes with your trusted companion, Python!

## The Mystery

It was a chilly winter evening when Sherlock Holmes received a mysterious letter from a client. The letter contained a cryptic message that read:

*"Dear Mr. Holmes,* 

*I am writing to you seeking assistance in solving a perplexing problem. I recently invested in the stock market, and my investments have resulted in significant losses due to the volatility of the market. I am convinced that there must be some patterns in market trends that I am missing. Can you help me develop a strategy for investing in the stock market that maximizes my profit while minimizing my risk?*

*Sincerely,*
*Your client"*

Sherlock Holmes was intrigued by the client's request and realized that it would require the application of advanced decision-making techniques in an uncertain environment. He knew that the client's problem could be modeled as an MDP, and to solve it, he must develop an efficient algorithm that continuously learns from the market trends and adapts to the changing environment.

## The Resolution

Sherlock Holmes decided to take on the challenge and spent the next few weeks developing an efficient algorithm for solving the client's problem. He used Python and applied the Online Markov Decision Processes technique to find the optimal strategy for investing in the stock market.

He started by constructing a model of the stock market as an MDP, where the states represented the different market trends, and the actions corresponded to the investments in different stocks. The rewards of the MDP were the profits or losses encountered by the investments.

To solve the MDP, Sherlock Holmes employed an online algorithm called the "Optimistic Policy Iteration" algorithm. The algorithm allowed the agent to learn the optimal policy by taking actions based on the estimates of the value function and continuously updating the estimates based on the observed rewards.

After implementing the algorithm, Sherlock Holmes ran several simulations of the stock market and evaluated the performance of the algorithm. The results showed that the algorithm could consistently maximize the profits while minimizing the risks, even in a volatile market environment.

With the successful resolution of the case, Sherlock Holmes sent a letter to the client with the results of his investigation. The client was ecstatic to receive the news and thanked Sherlock Holmes for his exceptional work.

And so, our adventure comes to a close, dear friends. We hope that you enjoyed this thrilling journey and have gained new insights into developing efficient strategies for decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments using Online Markov Decision Processes. Until next time!

## The Code

To solve the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we used Python programming language to implement the Online Markov Decision Processes technique. In particular, we applied the Optimistic Policy Iteration (OPI) algorithm to learn the optimal policy for investing in the stock market.

### The MDP Model

In our code, we represented the stock market as an MDP by defining the states, actions, and rewards. The states represented the different market trends that an investor could encounter, and the actions corresponded to the investments in different stocks. The rewards of the MDP were the profits or losses encountered by the investments.

```python
class StockMarketMDP:

    def __init__(self, n_states, n_actions, rewards, transitions):
        self.n_states = n_states
        self.n_actions = n_actions
        self.rewards = rewards
        self.transitions = transitions
```

### The Optimistic Policy Iteration Algorithm

We used the Optimistic Policy Iteration (OPI) algorithm to learn the optimal policy for investing in the stock market. OPI is an online algorithm that allows the agent to learn the optimal policy by taking actions based on the estimates of the value function and continuously updating the estimates based on the observed rewards.

```python
def optimistic_policy_iteration(mdp, policy, init_value, gamma, n_iterations):
    
    value = init_value.copy()
    
    for iteration in range(n_iterations):
        
        td_error = np.zeros((mdp.n_states, mdp.n_actions))
        
        for state in range(mdp.n_states):
            for action in range(mdp.n_actions):
                next_state_probs = mdp.transitions[state, action, :]
                expected_reward = np.dot(next_state_probs, mdp.rewards[state, action, :])
                next_state_value = np.dot(next_state_probs, value)
                td_error[state, action] = expected_reward + gamma * next_state_value - value[state]
            
        policy = optimistic_policy(mdp, value, td_error)
        
        for state in range(mdp.n_states):
            action = policy[state]
            next_state_probs = mdp.transitions[state, action, :]
            expected_reward = np.dot(next_state_probs, mdp.rewards[state, action, :])
            next_state_value = np.dot(next_state_probs, value)
            value[state] += alpha * (expected_reward + gamma * next_state_value - value[state])
    
    return policy, value
```

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the code we used to solve the Sherlock Holmes mystery relied on implementing the Online Markov Decision Processes technique in Python, applying the Optimistic Policy Iteration algorithm to find the optimal policy for investing in the volatile stock market. This algorithm allowed the agent to learn from the observed rewards and update the estimates of value of the states in the MDP, resulting in efficient decision-making and maximum returns on investment.
