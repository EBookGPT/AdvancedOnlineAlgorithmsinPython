# Chapter 17: Online Learning with Expert Advice

Welcome back, dear reader! In the last chapter, we delved into the world of Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithms, and learned about how they can be powerful tools for optimizing functions in a variety of contexts, including machine learning.

Now, we turn our attention to another fascinating topic in the world of online algorithms: Online Learning with Expert Advice. This is a powerful class of algorithms that can be used to make intelligent decisions in a wide range of applications, from finance to healthcare to e-commerce.

The basic idea behind Online Learning with Expert Advice is to combine the predictions of a number of different "experts" to make a final decision. Each expert provides a different prediction of what will happen in the future, and the algorithm weighs these predictions based on how accurate each expert has been in the past.

As you can imagine, this can be an extremely powerful technique, especially in domains where there is a lot of uncertainty and ambiguity. In this chapter, we'll explore the theory behind Online Learning with Expert Advice in detail, and we'll also write some code examples in Python to illustrate how this technique can be applied in practice.

So sit back, relax, and let's solve the mystery of Online Learning with Expert Advice!

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes had always been fascinated by the stock market, with its complex interplay of numbers, statistics, and human psychology. So, when a new mystery emerged in the world of finance, he was eager to dive in.

It all started when a string of large-scale frauds occurred in the financial district. Each fraud was carried out by a different group of insiders, and they seemed to be getting smarter and more sophisticated with each passing day. The authorities were at a loss to explain how the fraudsters were able to stay ahead of them, and the public was growing increasingly anxious.

Sherlock was determined to crack the case, and he soon began poring over reams of data related to the frauds. 

Finally, he was able to identify a pattern: although the fraudsters were constantly changing tactics, there was one thing that remained constant - they were always one step ahead of the authorities. This led him to believe that they were using some sort of predictive algorithm to anticipate the moves of their pursuers.

Sherlock knew that he would need to develop a similar algorithm in order to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters. After doing some research, he stumbled upon the concept of Online Learning with Expert Advice, a technique that had shown promise in a variety of domains, including finance.

But he quickly discovered that it was easier said than done. The stock market was an incredibly complex and dynamic system, and the experts who made predictions about its behavior were often wildly inconsistent - some were brilliant one day and terrible the next.

Sherlock knew that he would need to develop an algorithm that could cope with this degree of variability, and he set to work.

## The Resolution

After weeks of coding and testing, Sherlock finally had a working prototype of his algorithm. The key insight that had allowed him to succeed where others had failed was to weight the predictions of the different experts based on their past performance. By doing this, he was able to give more weight to the opinions of those who had been consistently accurate in the past, while downplaying the opinions of those who had been less reliable.

Sherlock quickly put his algorithm to the test, using it to predict the behavior of a variety of stocks over the coming weeks. To his delight, he found that it consistently outperformed the predictions of the individual experts, and he was able to use this to make a series of incredibly profitable trades.

In the end, Sherlock's algorithm proved to be a powerful tool in the fight against financial fraud. By using Online Learning with Expert Advice, he was able to stay one step ahead of the fraudsters, and make a significant contribution to the world of finance.

## The Code

Now that we've solved the mystery of the fraudsters and seen how Online Learning with Expert Advice can be used in practice, let's take a closer look at the code behind it all.

At its core, the algorithm is relatively simple. It works as follows:

1. We start with a set of _k_ experts who provide predictions about the future behavior of the stock market. We assume that each expert has a known success rate, which we can estimate based on their past predictions.

2. At each stage, we observe the actual behavior of the market, and use this to calculate the "regret" for each expert - that is, how much worse off we would have been if we had followed their advice instead of simply trusting the actual behavior of the market.

3. We then weight the predictions of each expert based on their past performance. Specifically, we give more weight to the opinions of those experts who have been consistently accurate in the past, while downplaying the opinions of those who have been less reliable.

4. Finally, we use these weighted predictions to make our own prediction about the future behavior of the market.

Here's some sample code that implements this algorithm in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

class Exp3:
    def __init__(self, n_arms, eta):
        self.n_arms = n_arms
        self.eta = eta
        self.weights = np.ones(n_arms)
        self.last_arm = None

    def get_weights(self):
        p = (1 - self.eta) * self.weights / np.sum(self.weights) + self.eta / self.n_arms
        return p

    def get_arm(self):
        p = self.get_weights()
        self.last_arm = np.random.choice(self.n_arms, p=p)
        return self.last_arm

    def update(self, reward):
        p = self.get_weights()
        if self.last_arm is not None:
            self.weights[self.last_arm] *= np.exp(self.eta * reward / p[self.last_arm] / self.n_arms)

```

This code implements an algorithm known as Exp3 (short for "Exponential-Weighted, version 3"), which is a variant of the classic Online Learning with Expert Advice algorithm. In this version, we assume that we have a fixed set of _k_ arms (i.e., experts), and we want to choose the best one at each round, based on the observed rewards.

The `Exp3` class has three key methods:

* `get_weights()`: returns a vector of weights for each arm, based on their past performance.
* `get_arm()`: samples an arm based on the weights.
* `update()`: updates the weights of the previously chosen arm, based on the observed rewards.

Together, these methods implement the basic Online Learning with Expert Advice algorithm. To use them, we would first initialize an instance of the `Exp3` class, and then run it for a certain number of rounds, updating the weights and choosing new arms at each step.

By doing this, we can develop an algorithm that is robust and adaptive, even in the face of uncertainty and ambiguity. So if you're looking for a powerful tool for making intelligent decisions in an online context, Online Learning with Expert Advice is definitely worth checking out!
