# Chapter 31: Online Learning with Side Information ðŸŽ“

Welcome back dear reader! In this chapter, we dive into the fascinating field of online learning with side information. But first, let's reminiscence about our last chapter.

Our last chapter, "Black-Box Online Optimization" was an invigorating read. We learned about the stochastic optimization problem and various methods to optimize it. We even had a special guest, Shai Shalev-Shwartz! He shared some invaluable insights on black-box optimization and its applications in real-world problems. His expertise and knowledge were truly inspiring.

But now it's time for us to delve into more advanced concepts. So, what exactly is online learning with side information? 

Simply put, it's the process of learning using additional information, side information, available in real-time. This side information can be of different types, such as contextual features or user feedback. For instance, in a recommendation system, we could have side information about the user's age, gender, and location, which can help us provide more relevant recommendations.

This chapter will cover the fundamentals of online learning with side information, its challenges, and various techniques to tackle those challenges. We'll also explore some practical applications of online learning with side information in recommendation systems, online advertising, product recommendations, and more.

So, buckle up and get ready to unravel the mysteries of online learning with side information!

**Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Mysterious User Feedback**

Mr. John Watson approached Sherlock Holmes with an unusual problem. He explained that he was developing a recommendation system for a famous e-commerce website, which required him to use user feedback to make personalized recommendations. He had implemented an online learning algorithm, but it was failing to converge, and he couldn't figure out why.

Sherlock Holmes took on the case and reviewed the code. He soon realized that the user feedback was not enough to make accurate recommendations. The algorithm was ignoring essential contextual features, such as user preferences and purchase history. The side information was crucial, and without it, the algorithm was bound to fail.

Holmes turned to his network of experts, and, coincidentally, he had a special guest, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, visiting him. Shalev-Shwartz was a renowned expert in online learning and black-box optimization, and Holmes knew he was just the man for the job.

Shalev-Shwartz suggested a solution based on the "Contextual Bandit" algorithm, which leverages the user feedback and contextual features to make personalized recommendations. The bandit algorithm, as it's called, balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the recommendation system learns while making useful recommendations.

Together, Holmes and Shalev-Shwartz worked on implementing the bandit algorithm and fine-tuning it for the e-commerce website's specific needs. They ran extensive tests and evaluations, and it worked like a charm! The recommendation system was now providing highly personalized recommendations based on both user feedback and contextual features.

Mr. Watson was thrilled and thanked Holmes and Shalev-Shwartz for their help. He learned that online learning with side information is a complex field, but with the right approach, it can revolutionize the e-commerce industry.

**Resolution:**

Through the contextual bandit algorithm, Holmes and his associate Shalev-Shwartz, solved the mystery of the non-converging online learning algorithm. By recognizing the importance of side information and suggesting an algorithm that could effectively leverage it, they created a highly successful recommendation system for the famous e-commerce website. The case was solved, and the power of online learning with side information was once again demonstrated.
Sure, let me explain the code used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery of the non-converging online learning algorithm.

Shalev-Shwartz recommended the use of the "Contextual Bandit" algorithm, which is a popular method for personalized recommendation systems that leverage side information. The Contextual Bandit algorithm is a combination of two conflicting goals: maximizing rewards (exploitation) and trying out new options (exploration).

The general structure of the Contextual Bandit algorithm involves three primary functions: prediction, exploration, and exploitation.

The prediction function predicts the reward or output value given a set of inputs, including both the user feedback and the side information. The exploration function encourages the algorithm to try out new recommendations, while the exploitation function optimizes recommendations based on past experiences.

Here's a sample Python code for implementing the Contextual Bandit algorithm:

```python
import numpy as np

class ContextualBandit:
    def __init__(self, n_arms, n_feats):
        self.n_arms = n_arms
        self.n_feats = n_feats
        self.theta = np.zeros((n_feats, n_arms)) #initialize theta at 0

    def get_reward(self, arm, x): #x is a vector of side-info/ context provided for user
        p = np.random.uniform(0, 1)
        if p < np.dot(x, self.theta[:, arm]):
            return 1
        else:
            return 0

    def predict(self, x): #predict which arm to pull
        arms = np.zeros(self.n_arms)
        for i in range(self.n_arms):
            arms[i] = np.dot(x, self.theta[:, i])
        return np.argmax(arms)

    def update(self, arm, x, reward): #update calculated reward values
        self.theta[:, arm] += x*(reward - 0.5)

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, n_arms, n_feats):
        self.n_arms = n_arms
        self.n_feats = n_feats
        self.t = 0
        self.reward_sum = 0
        self.bandit = ContextualBandit(self.n_arms, self.n_feats)

    def get_action(self, x):
        if self.t < self.n_arms:
            arm = self.t #force agent to explore first n_arms
        else:
            if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < 0.1: #10% of time explote
                arm = self.bandit.predict(x)
            else:
                arm = np.random.randint(0, self.n_arms) #90% of time explore at random
        reward = self.bandit.get_reward(arm, x)
        self.reward_sum += reward
        self.bandit.update(arm, x, reward)
        self.t += 1
        return arm

```

This Python code initializes the Contextual Bandit algorithm and the Agent who will be trained on that algorithm. The agent will pull an arm (meaning, make a decision) based on the Contextual Bandit algorithm's prediction. 

Afterward, the agent will observe a reward, and the rewards will be used to update the Contextual Bandit algorithm's parameters. The algorithm will update its parameters according to the side information included in each decision made by the agent. Finally, the agent will repeat the process, pulling an arm until it has enough information to start making accurate predictions that take into account both user feedback and contextual features.

With this code, Watson was able to implement the algorithm for the e-commerce website recommendation system, making personalized recommendations based on both user feedback and contextual information. This underscores the importance of online learning with side information in the modern data-driven economy.
