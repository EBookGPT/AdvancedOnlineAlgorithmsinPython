# Chapter 32 - Online Learning with Incomplete Feedback

Welcome back, my dear readers! In the previous chapter, we discussed online learning with side information. We saw how algorithms could make use of additional information known as side information to perform better in the online learning scenario. Now, we move on to a slightly different problem - incomplete feedback.

In some scenarios, such as in recommendation systems or advertisement, only partial feedback is available to us. In such cases, the feedback might be binary, e.g., whether the user liked an item or not. However, we don't know how much the user liked the item.

Using incomplete feedback presents a unique challenge, and traditional online learning algorithms might not be suitable to solve this problem. Therefore, in this chapter, we continue our journey to explore advanced online algorithms in Python that can handle incomplete feedback.

We will begin by discussing the basic concepts of this problem and then present some algorithms that can learn and make decisions using incomplete feedback. Additionally, we will also cover regret analysis, which will allow us to examine the theoretical bounds of these algorithms.

So, grab your hats and get ready for another thrilling ride with Sherlock Holmes as we continue our journey in the world of advanced online algorithms.
# Chapter 32 - Online Learning with Incomplete Feedback - Solve the Mystery

Sherlock Holmes and his trusted partner Dr. Watson had been asked to investigate a puzzling case by a major advertising firm. The advertising company wanted to deliver advertisement content specific to each user's interests in real-time. They had gathered data containing user clicks on ads, but there was no direct feedback on how much the user liked the ad displayed to them.

The company had turned to Sherlock Holmes to solve this riddle. They had made several attempts to solve the mystery themselves but to no avail. Holmes and Watson had taken up the case and were determined to catch the culprit.

They began to look through the data to identify any patterns. They discovered that certain users clicked multiple times on a particular type of advertisement. It was a start, but they still lacked adequate feedback to determine the success of the ads. 

As they dug deeper into the data, they discovered that some advertisements were clicked on more often than others. They hypothesized that certain user types might be more likely to click on certain ads than others. But how to find these hidden groups of users?

After scouring the internet for possible solutions, Holmes found an algorithm that could learn and make decisions in the presence of incomplete feedback. It was called "Exp3 algorithm." It's a variant of the multi-armed bandit algorithm that implicitly manages feedback, just like the case they were dealing with.

Holmes and Watson started to modify the algorithm, adding the feature to deal with side information. The definition of side information is information relevant to how users interact with advertisements but not directly related to ad feedback. An example for side information in the current scenario could be user demographics.

Implementing the modified algorithm brought results. The team was able to find several hidden groups of users based on their click habits. They observed that users in a specific age range clicked on ads related to sports, and users who clicked on ads related to electronics were also inclined to click on ads related to games.

The advertising company was thrilled with the results and implemented the modified "Exp3 algorithm." They were finally able to serve more specific ads for each user, and their click-through rate increased by 30% in just a month!

Thanks to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and their expert knowledge of advanced online algorithms, the advertising company successfully served better ads to its users, to the delight of all parties involved, and another mysterious case solved!

With this, we conclude our journey discussing advanced online algorithms in python, including incomplete feedback. We encourage you to experiment with the algorithms we discussed today and discover what other problems they can solve!
# Chapter 32 - Online Learning with Incomplete Feedback - The Code

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery about online learning with incomplete feedback, we utilized an algorithm called "Exp3 algorithm". It's an example of the traditional multi-armed bandit algorithm, modified to handle incomplete feedback.

The fundamental idea behind the Exp3 algorithm is to explicitly manage feedback and minimize the algorithm's regret (i.e., the difference between the algorithm's expected rewards vs. if it had chosen the true best ad). Here is an outline of the algorithm:

```python
# Initialization
n_arms = len(ad_list)  # Number of ads
weights = np.array([1.0] * n_arms)  # Initialization of weights
scores = np.array([0.0] * n_arms)  # Initialization of scores

# Exp3 Algorithm
for i in range(n_iterations):
    # Choose ad to display
    prob_dist = (1 - gamma) * (weights / np.sum(weights)) + gamma / n_arms
    arm_chosen = np.random.choice(n_arms, p=prob_dist)

    # Display ad to user and receive partial feedback
    feedback = get_feedback(arm_chosen)

    # Update weights and scores
    factor = (feedback / prob_dist[arm_chosen]) if prob_dist[arm_chosen] > 0 else 1
    weights[arm_chosen] *= np.exp(gamma / n_arms * factor)
    scores[arm_chosen] += feedback / prob_dist[arm_chosen]

# Prediction
prediction = ad_list[np.argmax(scores)]
```

The algorithm starts by initializing the number of arms available to the user and the weights assigned to each arm at the beginning. It then enters a loop where it selects the ad to display randomly, considering past ads weighting and incomplete feedback. It obtains a user's partial feedback based on the displayed ad and decides how much to update the weights and scores. The algorithm ends the loop after a predefined number of iterations and chooses the ad with the highest record of scores as the best ad. 

The Exp3 algorithm is one of the many algorithms commonly used to solve the problem of incomplete feedback. In this mystery, we modified the algorithm to take into account side information about users. Further research may lead to developing other modified multi-armed bandit algorithms optimized for specific issues in incomplete feedback cases.
