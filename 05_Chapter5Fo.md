# Chapter 5: Follow-the-Leader Algorithms

Greetings, dear readers! I hope you have enjoyed our journey so far as we traversed through the exciting world of online algorithms in Python. In the previous chapter, we explored the concept of regret minimization and its significance in online learning.

As we step into the new chapter, we will delve into another essential online algorithm - Follow-the-Leader (FTL) algorithms. Just as the name suggests, FTL algorithms enable the algorithm to mimic the actions of the best-performing arm or course of action.

In the context of online learning, FTL algorithms allow the algorithm to learn from the mistakes and successes of previous iterations and optimize the decision-making process. In a way, this approach can enhance the learning process and reduce the chances of mistakes in future iterations.

Follow-the-Leader algorithms have many real-world applications, including stock trading, production line optimization, and even vehicle routing. So, buckle up, dear readers, as we embark on a thrilling journey to unravel the mysteries behind Follow-the-Leader algorithms using Python code.
# Chapter 5: Follow-the-Leader Algorithms

## The Case of the Vanishing Diamonds

"Blasted thieving scoundrels," exclaimed Holmes, as he waved his hand in frustration. "If only we had a tool to predict their next move!"

"What do you have in mind, Holmes?" I asked.

"I believe we can use Follow-the-Leader algorithms to track their pattern and predict the next target," Holmes replied, his eyes twinkling with excitement.

The mystery had started when the Crown Jewels of England had been stolen from the Tower of London. The master thief had left zero traces, and it had left the police flummoxed. The stakes were high, and the nation could not afford to lose its precious jewels.

Holmes had surmised that the pattern of robberies, while seemingly random, could be tracked using Follow-the-Leader algorithms. He set out to build an algorithm that would track the movements of the thief based on the location of previous robberies.

Using the Follow-the-Leader algorithm, Holmes input the locations of the previous thefts and ran the algorithm to determine the next location. The algorithm analyzed the data, determined the most frequent locations, and predicted the next target.

We waited anxiously, and soon our predictions came to pass. The thief had indeed targeted the predicted location next, and we were able to catch him red-handed.

With the Crown Jewels returned safely, we offered our thanks to the trusty Follow-the-Leader algorithm, that had helped us crack the seemingly impossible case.

## The Solution: Implementation of Follow-the-Leader Algorithm

Following in Holmes' footsteps, let's illustrate how the Follow-the-Leader algorithm can be implemented for predicting future actions. 

Here is a sample Python code snippet for the Follow-the-Leader algorithm:

``` python
import numpy as np

# Initialize the history
history = []

# Define the function to find the best-performing arm
def best_arm(history):
    arm_rewards = [0] * len(history[0])

    for i in range(len(history)):
        for j in range(len(history[0])):
            arm_rewards[j] += history[i][j]

    return np.argmax(arm_rewards)

# Define the Follow-the-Leader algorithm
def follow_the_leader(history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return best_arm(history)

# Update the history
history.append([0, 1, 0, 0])

# Predict the best-performing arm
prediction = follow_the_leader(history)
```

Here, the `best_arm` function calculates the sum of all rewards received over each arm history and returns the index of the best-performing arm. The `follow_the_leader` function uses the `best_arm` function to determine the predicted best-performing arm based on the `history`. Finally, the `history` is updated, and the algorithm predicts the best-performing arm.

## The Case of the Vanishing Diamonds

To crack the case of the Vanishing Diamonds, Sherlock Holmes implemented the Follow-the-Leader algorithm. This algorithm allowed him to track the pattern of robberies over time and predict the next target, leading to the capture of the thief.

Here's a breakdown of the code used to resolve the mystery.

### Initializing the History

``` python
history = []
```

The `history` variable is initialized as an empty array. In this case, it would store an array of the locations of the previous robberies.

### Finding the Best Arm

``` python
def best_arm(history):
    arm_rewards = [0] * len(history[0])

    for i in range(len(history)):
        for j in range(len(history[0])):
            arm_rewards[j] += history[i][j]

    return np.argmax(arm_rewards)
```

The `best_arm` function calculates the total reward of each arm from the `history` of previous robberies. The function initializes an array `arm_rewards` of zeroes for the length the history of the previous robberies. It then loops through the history and increments the total reward for the appropriate arm.

Finally, the function returns the index of the arm with the best-reward using the numpy `argmax` method.

### Follow-the-Leader Algorithm

``` python
def follow_the_leader(history):
    if len(history) == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return best_arm(history)
```

The `follow_the_leader` function predicts the best-performing arm. If `history` is empty, it will choose the first arm as the predicted best-performing arm. However, if some information is available from the previous `history`, it will use the `best_arm` function to predict the next best-performing arm. 

### Updating the History

``` python
history.append([0, 1, 0, 0])
```

The `history` is updated every time the thief strikes at a new location. The `append` method is used to insert the new location into the history list.

### Prediction Using the Follow-the-Leader Algorithm

``` python
prediction = follow_the_leader(history)
```

The `follow_the_leader` algorithm predicts the next target by running the `best_arm` function on the current `history`. The best-performing arm is returned as the prediction for the next target.

Through the clever use of Follow-the-Leader algorithms, Sherlock Holmes was able to successfully solve the mystery of the Vanishing Diamonds.
