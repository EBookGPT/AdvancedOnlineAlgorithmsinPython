# The Mystery of Regret Minimization: An Introduction

The stakes were high in the quaint town of Baker Street. The famous detective Sherlock Holmes had been presented with a puzzling case that had everyone stumped. The case involved a wealthy gentleman who had made a fortune on the stock market, but his recent bets had all turned out to be busts. Despite his expertise in the field, he wasn't able to predict the erratic behavior of the market. With his future on the line, the gentleman had come to Sherlock in the hopes of finding a solution.

Sherlock, being the master detective that he was, was convinced that the solution to the gentleman's problem was rooted in the domain of Regret Minimization. Having just finished a case on Online Convex Optimization with special guest Sébastien Bubeck, Sherlock invited him over once again to help him crack the case. 

In this chapter, we will join Sherlock and Sébastien as they dive into the world of Regret Minimization. Together we will explore how this field of study can help us minimize our regrets when making sequential decisions. We will witness the power of techniques such as the Multiplicative Weights update algorithm, and we'll see how these algorithms can be implemented in Python for real-world applications.

Join us on this thrilling journey as we work hand in hand with Sherlock and Sébastien to solve this mysterious case through the power of Regret Minimization.
# The Mystery of the Mysteriously Moving Stocks

Sherlock Holmes was at his desk, mulling over the case presented to him by a wealthy gentleman who had been having severe troubles predicting the stock market. He was getting anxious, and his future was at stake. Sherlock was confident that Regret Minimization held the key to a solution, so he called on his trusted friend, special guest Sébastien Bubeck, to help him navigate the intricacies of the market and minimize the gentleman's regrets.

Sébastien suggested that Sherlock use the Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm to help analyze the market data and predict its movements. They immediately got to work, implementing the algorithm in Python and feeding data derived from the gentleman's trades. It didn't take long before they started noticing interesting patterns. 

They realized that the gentleman had been trying to predict the movements of very volatile stocks, which were constantly shifting in value, making them hard to predict with certainty. But using the algorithm, they were able to calculate the weights of his bets in order to minimize his total regret, assuming he had invested equal amounts of money in each stock. 

The final puzzle piece came from Sherlock, who realized that the gentleman had been investing in stocks in a non-random fashion, causing him to make specific choices that didn't lend themselves to the algorithm's assumptions. They used their newly acquired knowledge to suggest he make specific bets on the most stable stocks on the market, with a weighted distribution based on Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm results.

In the end, the gentleman was able to recover his losses thanks to Sherlock and Sébastien's use of Regret Minimization. It was clear that by leveraging the power of Advanced Online Algorithms in Python, they were able to achieve what would have been impossible by human intuition alone. The gentleman was grateful beyond words, knowing that with Sherlock and Sébastien's help, he could tackle the unpredictability of the market with confidence.
Now, let's dive deeper into the code used to solve the mysterious case of the moving stocks. The Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU) algorithm played a key role in this case, allowing Sherlock and Sébastien to analyze market data and make predictions that were more precise than ones made through human intuition alone.

## Implementing the MWU Algorithm

The MWU algorithm is quite simple to implement. First, we assume that the gentleman has invested equal amounts of money in each stock. We can represent this as a list of weights `w`, where each weight corresponds to a stock in the gentleman's portfolio.

```python
# Assume that the gentleman has invested equal amounts of money in each stock
w = [1/len(stocks) for _ in range(len(stocks))]
```

Next, we calculate the gain or loss `g` associated with the selected stocks. Based on this gain, we update the weights according to the following formula:

```python
# Calculate the gain or loss (g) based on the selected stocks
g = (selected_stock_value - initial_stock_value) / initial_stock_value

# Update the weights using the MWU Algorithm
for i in range(len(stocks)):
  w[i] = w[i] * math.exp(-learning_rate * g * stock_data[i])
```

In this formula, `selected_stock_value` and `initial_stock_value` are the values of the selected stock and the initial stock value, respectively. `learning_rate` controls the rate at which the algorithm learns from mistakes, and `stock_data[i]` is the market data associated with the `i`-th stock.

## Implementing Specific Bets

When Sherlock and Sébastien realized that the gentleman had been investing in stocks in a non-random fashion, they suggested that he make specific bets on the most stable stocks on the market with a weighted distribution based on MWU algorithm results. To implement this, we can sort the `w` weights in descending order and use them to weight the bets.

```python
# Sort the weights in descending order
sorted_weights = sorted(w, reverse=True)

# Invest in stocks with the highest weights
bet_on = sorted_weights[:num_stocks_to_bet]

# Weight the bets using the sorted weights
bet_weights = [i/sum(bet_on) for i in bet_on]

# Place the bets on the selected stocks
for stock, weight in zip(stocks, bet_weights):
  place_bet(stock, weight)
``` 

This code takes the sorted list of weights `sorted_weights`, and takes the first `num_stocks_to_bet` stocks to place bets on. It then weights these stocks by dividing the respective weights by the sum of the selected weights to normalize them, and places bets on each stock with the selected weights.

With this code in hand, Sherlock and Sébastien were able to help the gentleman recover his losses and minimize his future regrets when it came to investing in the stock market. Through the power of Regret Minimization, they were able to accomplish what would have been impossible without algorithmic analysis.
